Here at Navigraph we have been deliberately secretive about our upcoming charts product, and only presented a few of the new features. However, as we are approaching launch date, and still have some more features to show, we are now ready to unveil the greatest improvement to Navigraph Charts to date: In the next version of Navigraph Charts, all chart data will be provided by Jeppesen.

**Enhanced SID and STAR Chart Format**  
The new version of Navigraph Charts will display Jeppesen’s new and enhanced SID and STAR chart format featuring, among other things, colored topography and true-to-scale depiction.

The new format has several improvements which we will cover in a separate blog post later on. However, in the picture above, you can see the regular grid of Minimum Off Route Altitudes (MORA), the red Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA) circle, navaid symbology and associated speed restrictions in red text.  

**Charts and NavData from One Source** 
Navigraph Charts will also contain enroute charts that are dynamically rendered based on Jeppesen NavData. Using Jeppesen as a provider for all data will ensure synchronized information between airport charts, enroute charts, addon data formats, and any other data displayed in Navigraph apps and software. The enroute charts will also, to a great extent, use the symbology of the enhanced SID and STAR chart format. Chart updates will follow the regular 28-day AIRAC cycle.

  
**Features Enabled by the Jeppesen Format**  
The new Jeppesen charts format will add many benefits and enable additional functionality requested by our users to the Navigraph Charts software.

1. First and foremost, the coverage will dramatically increase to 6,784 airports. This is the most comprehensive coverage available.
2. Secondly, with the Jeppesen chart format we can now offer charts in a darker night mode color scheme.
3. Thirdly, since Jeppesen charts are generally geo referenced and true-to-scale, we will be able to place an ownship overlay (“moving maps”) on top of the charts, aiding situational awareness during a flight.

**User Preference** 
In addition to the user requested features that were technically made available through the Jeppesen chart format, the change to Jeppesen is also based on the results of our user survey where a majority of 2,200 participants reported being the most familiar with Jeppesen charts, and preferring the Jeppesen format among four different chart formats.
