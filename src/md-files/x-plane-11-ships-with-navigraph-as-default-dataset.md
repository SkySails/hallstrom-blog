[X-Plane 11](http://www.x-plane.com/) is expected out any day now. We are all eager to see what the new user interface looks like; experience the new effects; the European autogen scenery; and also see what has been done in the IFR department. Of particular interest to us here at Navigraph is that X-Plane 11 will be using one single navigational database. Instead of many databases feeding different functions and addons, like in the case of some other flight simulation software, X-Plane 11 will have one single database used for scenery, map, ATC, AI and the GPS/FMS. If you would like to know more about the structure of the new X-Plane data you might find Philipp Münzel’s post on the X-Plane developer blog interesting:<http://developer.x-plane.com/?article=navdata-in-x-plane-11> 

 Throughout the development process of the new data format Laminar Research and Navigraph have been in frequent contact, and we are therefore happy to say that we are supporting X-Plane 11 immediately from launch. Moreover, all copies of X-Plane 11 are installed with a recent default dataset provided by Navigraph.
