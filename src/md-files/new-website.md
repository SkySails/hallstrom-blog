Have you seen our new [website](https://navigraph.com)? We have made some nice improvements over the previous one that we would like to show you.

**Your Account**  
First off - we have created a special area for you as a Navigraph user. You start by signing in via the button in the upper right corner using either your username like before or your email address. Being able to use both should make it easier to get in.

In this special area we have gathered everything Navigraph users have access to - like download links to all of the software you can use: desktop software, web clients as well as apps.

Under your account pages you can easily see your subscription state, due dates, and also add more than one payment method as a backup to ensure continuous and uninterrupted service.

On your account pages you can now see all your signed in sessions and all devices where you use your Navigraph account. This is a nice security measure and also helps you check that Simlink is providing Moving Maps functionality to the right Navigraph account for example.

**Purchasing Subscriptions**  
Moving on you may notice that purchasing a new subscription looks a little different. If you are an existing user, just sign in and purchase a subscription directly from your account pages. You can also just press the big orange button on in the middle of the website. As you enter your email address we will figure out if you are a new or existing user.  

**Responsive Design**  
Are you reading this on your phone? Well, then you’ll be happy to know that our website is now responsive meaning that it scales to fit smaller screens. This should make it easier to manage your subscription on the fly when you’re not in front of your stationary computer.

**New Addons Listing**  
Another thing we have redesigned is the list of manual FMS Data installers. They are now located on the account pages. You have to sign in to see it. (Look under the FMS Data section in the menu under your account pages.) We will eventually discontinue the manual installers and rely completely on the FMS Data Manager so if you haven’t made the switch yet, now is a good time. However, have a look at the listing - we made an attempt in making it clearer sorting by developer, addon name and software type. We will be revisiting this list later on as we further improve the way we present the addon software.

All in all we are happy with the improvements and have managed to address many of the shortcomings of the previous website. This is of course an ongoing work so if you have any feedback on how we can improve please let us know! There is a separate [forum section](https://forum.navigraph.com/viewforum.php?f=17) for that.
