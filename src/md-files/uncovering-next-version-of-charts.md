We are kicking off this developer blog in a grand way by announcing the biggest piece of news since ever in the history of Navigraph: For over a year now we have been working in stealth mode to completely relaunch the Charts product line. The next version of Charts, scheduled for launch early 2017, will include new clients for phones and tablets (iOS and Android), new desktop clients (Windows and Mac), and a new web browser client.

Not only are we covering more devices than ever, we have also included a lot of new functionality. Over the next few weeks we are going to present the new features which we have included in the next version of Charts here on this blog. We have really tried to tune into our users’ requests and have been able to tick off many items on the wish list.

Features aside, the biggest and most notable change with the new Charts product is that the coverage is going to grow dramatically. This is why we would like to call this post “the biggest piece of news since ever in the history of Navigraph”. Upon launch, you will be able to view charts from just about any IFR airport around the world!

Where do we get this massive coverage from? Stick around and you’ll see.

All for now,

The Navigraph Development Team
