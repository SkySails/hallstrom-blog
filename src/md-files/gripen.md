## Gripen – controlling the battlespace in a changing world

Fighting in modern conflict requires being, persistent and constantly one step ahead of potential threats and opponents. Rapid technological progress has driven the development of longer reach weapons and radars with greater precision, low signature targets and advanced electronic warfare. Air combat is now defined and driven by technology. But it’s also about how to use technology in a smart way. Born to fight a superpower, smart thinking is in the Gripen DNA. We think "smart" is all about what’s on the inside of a fighter, not what’s on the outside.

Gripen’s unique avionics architecture is the definition of smart. It might not sound exciting, but it is a game-changer. It means we can reconfigure the inside of Gripen without affecting the airframe. Or put another way, we can rapidly upgrade Gripen’s avionics whenever new technology becomes available. With Gripen you will always have the newest, fastest computers running the latest algorithms, the latest sensors and the most advanced weaponry. It gives you the advantage to see more and act faster than your opponent. In an age where software beats hardware and adaptability beats predictability, Gripen has redefined what it means to fight smart. We fight with technological force. That’s why we call it the Smart Fighter.

## Gripen E-series

Gripen E-series is a new fighter aircraft system. Developed to counter and defeat advanced future threats, the E-series is for customers with more pronounced threats or wider territories to secure. Designed to defeat any adversary. Made for forward-thinking air forces, Gripen E incorporates cutting-edge technologies, the latest systems, sensors and weapons to ensure combat advantage, delivering Air Superiority in highly contested environments. Gripen E re-defines the rules of the game.

The E-series has a new and more powerful engine, improved range performance and the ability to carry greater payloads. It also has a new AESA-radar, InfraRed Search and Track System (IRST), highly advanced electronic warfare and communication systems together with superior situational awareness. The E-series redefines air power for the 21st century by extending operational capabilities.

## Defeat any threat. Anywhere.

Gripen E-series carries a variety of both active and passive measures to disrupt enemy efforts and protect itself and other friendly units. Its advanced electronic warfare system, similar to an electronic shield, allows disruption of the enemy’s ability to function effectively. This can be used either to assist in destruction of enemy assets or simply to reduce the enemy’s ability to act. All this while ensuring mission success, using the latest weaponry and countermeasures

## See the unseen. Before being seen.

The ability to attack or assess opposition at range is a key feature in the E-series. Gripen E-series utilizes all available data in the battle cloud – whether coming from Gripen fighters or other air, land or sea-based units, and fuses it locally on every platform but we are also fusing globally between fighters. The result: We see the unseen. Gripen E-series reduces the likelihood of being detected by relying on its passive sensors, or through active jamming. This means that weapons can be used either beyond the point at which opposing forces can respond or without them ever realising Gripen was there in the first place.

## In control. Intuitively.

When at the peak of a complex mission, every second counts. Man and machine need to work together to stay ahead of the opponent. Gripen E-series achieves the optimal balance between the pilot's and the fighter's workload, letting fighter intelligence take on a larger role. Like a sixth sense. Gripen E-serie’s fighter intelligence has the capability to work autonomously on several areas simultaneously, and provides the pilot with suggestions. Suggestions ranging from anything between weapon selection and maneuvering of the fighter. The right tactical information is shared and displayed at the right moment, enabling quick and precise decision making. This allows the Gripen E pilot to be in control – intuitively.

## Adapt Fast. Stay Relevant.

Gripen E-series offers a fighter which rapidly adapts to unfolding technological developments and stays operationally relevant over time. Equipped with a smart avionics architecture, existing algorithms can be updated by new ones without reducing the high availability of the aircraft. The architecture is also the basis for making rapid hardware and weaponry updates, with a high degree of customization possible for each customer nation. Gripen E-series will not only allow you to keep at pace with evolution, it will allow you to lead it
