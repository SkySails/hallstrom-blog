## Cycle 2107 out now

Cycle 2107 has been released! Update your tools and add-on aircraft FMS databases using the FMS Data Manager, and using the Navigraph Navdata Center for MSFS 2020 users. The current Jeppesen charts are already available through the Navigraph Charts apps.

## Updates to Navigraph services for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

The Navigraph Navdata Center is our latest desktop application. It will not only update your Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 with navigational data from Jeppesen, but also install the new Navigraph Charts In-Game Panel.

Navigraph Navdata Center can now be downloaded from the [Account > Downloads](https://navigraph.com/account/downloads/navdata?utm_source=newsletter&utm_content=link_account_downloads&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2107) section when logged in to your account on navigraph.com. Once installed, log in to the application with your Navigraph credentials and install our packages!

The Charts-In Game panel allows you to access the functionalities of the Navigraph Charts app inside the simulator, without the need for an external device or monitor.

[![To access Navigraph charts, log in and sign up for the Ultimate subscription by clicking here.](https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LPqw8yjc_JyR6YApOQwOFjhrmOmXh8Ov_gBmt74WcEgS7yx73MMc19NrD2Ta59SRbgbWFn_xX2ba-RpV_oFw3JjzNA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://legacy.navigraph.com/ecmp/99/image_1.jpg)](https://navigraph.com/account/subscription?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=2107_1&utm_content=navigraph_home_thumb)

Since the release of AIRAC cycle 2106, an update to the Charts In-Game Panel has been released following constructive feedback from the community in our [support forum](https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.navigraph.com%2F?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=forum_home_link_1&utm_campaign=2107). The following features have been added in the latest version:

- The currently loaded flightplan in the simulator can now be imported by prompt or the "New flight" menu. This requires that the loaded flightplan has at least an origin and destination specified.

- A new design for the sign-in page brings a refreshing look as well as the ability to sign in with a single click by pressing on a URL.

- The pinboard should now correctly display and operate a horizontal scrollbar.

- The virtual keyboard implementation was extended to operate in additional areas of the app.

- The keyboard interactions when typing into input fields such as the search field no longer causes unwanted interaction with cockpit switches or other toolbar panels.

- The charts icon remains the same size when running on high-resolution displays.

If you are running an earlier version of the In-Game Panel, simply open Navigraph Navdata Center and click the "Update" button next to the Navigraph Charts In-Game panel.

If you're new to the Charts In-Game panel, check out this [video](https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F-DcXGHSIvcY?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=yt_charts_ingame_panel_link&utm_campaign=2107) where our Pilot and Community Manager Andy displays it and takes you through the installation process.

## Video tip from the team: VOR circling approach tutorial in MSFS 2020

Thecorporatepilotdad is a YouTube content creator and professional pilot. In his latest tutorial he performs a VOR approach with circling to land at Rifle, Colorado (KRIL) using the PMDG DC-6 in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.

## Cycle 2108 out now

Cycle 2108 has been released! Update your tools and add-on aircraft FMS databases using the FMS Data Manager, and using the Navigraph Navdata Center for MSFS 2020 users. The current Jeppesen charts are already available through the Navigraph Charts apps.

## Navdata updates for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

The Navigraph development team is continuously doing work to enhance our charts and navdata services. Thanks to user postings in [forum.navigraph.com](https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.navigraph.com%2F?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=forum_home_link_1&utm_campaign=2108), we have been able to improve the accuracy of our navdata service for MSFS 2020 during the past months.

::full-bleed{src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/dMg0jA3djskUQM9hAhDplIA0sPCuAQsAogH2BlhSbDJVKWC_m_2kKB8-oe6-pKkEuq5Rmi6Zz8a0XicId6r9tFDYKNQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://legacy.navigraph.com/ecmp/100/image_1.jpg"}

Our navdata development team recently had a breakthrough when investigating a number of approaches in MSFS 2020 that had a slightly misaligned ILS course. We are happy to announce that with Jeppesen data from Navigraph, all ILS approach courses are now aligned with the centreline, and identical to the Jeppesen charts. Courses for offset approaches LDA/IGS that were previously misaligned are now also correct.

Here is a full list of navdata enhancements and issues that have been addressed during the past months:

AIRAC 2107 Revision 4 (2021-08-06):

- Helicopter records removed to avoid double approach-idents (thanks to FBW)

AIRAC 2107 Revision 3 (2021-07-31):

- Adjustments for full Sim Update 5 compatibility

AIRAC 2107 Revision 2 (2021-07-29):

- COM frequency adjustments for in-game ATC

AIRAC 2106 Revision 4 (2021-06-23):

- Improved accuracy of ILS/LOC, LDA, IGS and SDF approaches

AIRAC 2106 Revision 3 (2021-06-21):

- New ILS offset fix in place, addressing misalignment issues

- ILS localizer courses now 100% identical to the charts

- ILS offset approaches (LDA, IGS, etc) localizer courses fixed using new logic

AIRAC 2106 Revision 2 (2021-06-19):

- Navdata fully compatible with the World Update 5

- ILS backcourses set correctly

- New ILS offset calculation added for better offset support

- Approaches not supported by MSFS 2020 (GLS, MLS etc) changed from ILS to GPS approaches, to avoid auto-tune issues

We would like to thank all users who are submitting reports through our [support forum](https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.navigraph.com%2F?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=forum_home_link_2&utm_campaign=2108), allowing us to further enhance our navdata services.
