We are very excited to announce the first successful cockpit integration of Navigraph Charts in a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 in-game aircraft. You can now view Jeppesen charts inside the simulator and also follow along on procedures and during taxiing using the moving maps functionality. In this video, the Working Title developers Matt and Dominik, walk us through how the Charts interface works onboard the Cessna Citation CJ4\. 

In this interview, Matt and Dominik from Working Title talk about the modifications they have made to the default Cessna Citation CJ4 aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020\. We here at Navigraph are especially impressed by the reworked flight planning system and the improved autopilot functionality. The airplane flies procedures as intended and steadily follows the autopilot settings. 

While we may be partial in the matter, we think that the highlight in this video interview is the charts demo where Matt walks Andy, Navigraph’s Community Manager, through the charts implementation. Yes, Working Title has, as a world’s first, successfully integrated Navigraph Charts into the cockpit environment of an in-game Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 aircraft. The charts, supplied by Jeppesen, are integrated just like in the Proline 21 avionics system featured on the real CJ4 and work seamlessly in conjunction with the FMS. This feature was originally developed by Jeppesen and Rockwell Collins and we are excited to be able to contribute to the realism by enabling the same functionality to the flight simulation community through our Charts API.

In this video Dominik shows the benefits of having charts displayed alongside the procedure in the PFD. Matt also comments on how a real pilot would double check the minimas in the charts and add those restrictions manually to the flight plan in the FMC.

  
**Installation Instructions**  
Since this is a modification to an in-game aircraft you need to be a little tech savvy to improve your Cessna Citation CJ4\. The files you need are available from GitHub. What’s this GitHub we speak of? Take it easy - here’s how you do it:

The Working Title CJ4 mod can be downloaded from [here](https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FWorking-Title-MSFS-Mods%2Ffspackages%2Freleases%2Ftag%2Fcj4-v0.11.0&utm_source=blog&utm_medium=link_github_workingtitle_cj4&utm_campaign=WTCJ4). 

In order to install the mod, copy the workingtitle-aircraft-cj4 folder inside the zip file to your MSFS Community folder. 

Don’t know where your MSFS Community folder is located? Here is one way to find it: 

1. Start MSFS 2020
2. From the main menu, go to “Options”
3. Click “General”
4. Navigate to “Developers”, which can be found at the bottom of the list
5. Turn the developer mode on, then apply and save
6. A “Dev Mode” menu appears at the top. Click on “Tools”, then “Virtual File System” from this menu
7. Under “Watched Bass” the location of your community folder will be displayed, which is normally the 3rd directory from the top.

The developer mode may be turned off by navigating back to “Developers” from the main menu. 

**Other Charts Implementations**  
While the CJ4 from Working Title is the first FS2020 in-game aircraft to display Navigraph Charts, several other developers have already implemented the Navigraph Charts API on other simulator platforms.

One of the first to start using the Charts API was Folke Will developing Avitab for X-Plane. Avitab can be used in many different ways, but a nice implementation can be seen in the Zibo B737 aircraft available for X-Plane. On Microsoft Flight Simulator X and Lockeed Martin Prepar3D PMDG has integrated Navigraph Charts into the virtual flightdecks of the B747, 737 NGXu and recently the 777\. Aerosoft has also implemented Navigraph Charts in their A330 EFB, as have QualityWings in their B787 EFB.

At the time of writing this, we are also working with the FlyByWire Simulations team to make Navigraph Charts available inside their popular A32NX mod for FS2020.

**Great for Virtual Reality**  
One of the great benefits of having charts directly on a virtual flight deck, in addition to having moving maps and the ability to view procedures side by side with cockpit instruments, is the fact that you don’t have to leave the cockpit environment to view the charts. This is great news for all you Virtual Reality enthusiasts out there that don’t want to break immersion during your flights.

In previous FlightSim Community Surveys we have noted how VR usage is less common during the preparatory stages of flight. Now, with everything available inside the virtual cockpit, including Simbrief flight plan import, you don’t have to peer out underneath your headset but can stay immersed in the virtual world.  

**Upcoming Navigraph Developer Portal**  
Developers who wish to implement the Navigraph Charts API on virtual flightdecks should keep an eye out for the upcoming Navigraph Developer Portal. We are also happy to discuss your project at [dev@navigraph.com](mailto:dev@navigraph.com).
