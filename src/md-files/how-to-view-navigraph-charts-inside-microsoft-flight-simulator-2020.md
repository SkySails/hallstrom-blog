Navigraph is proud to offer the flight simulation community professional, worldwide, and updated airport/terminal charts from Jeppesen. The chart format is based on research by human factors specialists and subject matter experts, and is the real-world choice for many of the world’s airlines. The aim is to describe approach and departure procedures from airports with a clear presentation of altitudes, obstacles and landing minima during Instrument Flight Rules.

The charts are accessible in our suite of apps, ranging from desktop and cloud versions to tablet apps through App Store and Google Play. Now the charts can also be accessed inside Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 using the Charts In-Game Panel. This integration allows you to access the functionalities of the Navigraph Charts app inside the simulator, without the need for an external device or monitor.

The In-Game Panel is accessible from your MSFS 2020 toolbar, allowing you to access all the Navigraph Charts functionalities straight from the simulator in just a few clicks.   
  
**How to install the Charts In-Game Panel**  
  
The In-Game Panel can be installed into MSFS 2020 using Navigraph Navdata Center, a desktop application that can be downloaded from the “Downloads” section when logged in to your Navigraph account on [navigraph.com](https://href.li/?https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnavigraph.com%2Fhome?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=social&utm_content=navigraph_home_link&utm_campaign=ingame_panel).

The Navigraph Navdata Center will also allow you to update the navigational database in MSFS 2020 with Jeppesen navdata from Navigraph. By updating the navigational database, you will ensure that the navdata in your simulator matches the charts displayed in our applications.

If you have a Navigraph Ultimate subscription, you will be able to enjoy all the features and access over 7,000 Jeppesen charts globally. If you don’t have an Ultimate subscription, you can still try Navigraph Charts in a feature-complete Demo mode, where coverage is limited to (and the enroute area in between) Wellington, New Zealand (NZWN) and Brisbane, Australia (YBBN).

When the In-Game Panel has been installed, start your simulator and create a flight. A Navigraph icon has now been added to your MSFS 2020 toolbar. By clicking the icon, you will be prompted to sign in with your Navigraph credentials. If you have a secondary device nearby, simply scan the QR code that is presented to verify your Navigraph account. You can also verify your credentials by following the presented link that takes you to a sign-in page via your desktop browser. 

**Virtual keyboard integration**   
  
In addition to the features the Charts desktop application offers, the Charts In-Game panel gives you the option to use it’s virtual keyboard. Having a keyboard presented on the screen to enter information into the charts interface, can be a useful complement to your desktop keyboard, especially if you are flying in VR. You can still use your regular keyboard to type information into the Charts In-Game panel.
