SimBrief.com is our free, web-based, flight planning tool that produces accurate briefing packages for flight simulation. When creating a flight plan using SimBrief.com, a briefing package similar to those real-world pilots use will be generated. In this article, we will cover some of the latest feature additions to SimBrief that have been realized thanks to [this posting](https://href.li/?https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum.navigraph.com%2Ft%2Fgeneral-feature-request-summarized%2F6035?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=social&utm_content=forum_sb_feature_req&utm_campaign=simbrief_updates_sep_21) in the Navigraph forum. 

**Enroute and takeoff alternate range rings added to interactive map**

A takeoff alternate airport is used if an aircraft would not be able to return to its departure airport shortly after takeoff. This would be required if the weather at the departure airport is satisfactory for takeoff, but not for landing. SimBrief now displays takeoff alternate range rings on the interactive map, providing you with a clear overview of the different takeoff alternate options.

An enroute alternate is an aerodrome that can be used in the event that a diversion would become necessary while flying enroute. This is required when flying extended range operations with two engines. You can now display the enroute alternate search area as a ring on the interactive map in SimBrief, allowing you to easily select an enroute alternate if needed.

To display takeoff and enroute alternate rings, scroll down to the “Alternate Airports” section when creating a flight using the the Integrated Dispatch System. Pressing “Customize” will allow you to view the takeoff and enroute alternate rings by clicking their respective “Find” buttons. For take-off alternate, you may also customize the maximum search distance by entering a value in the field on the right hand side of the “Takeoff Alternate” subsection.

**Alternate airframe sharing links** 

It is now possible to share an airframe type in SimBrief that is updated when edits are made. Previously, SimBrief users were only able to share airframes that won’t reflect any subsequent edits. You now have the option to choose between sharing an airframe that reflect your latest changes, or one that will remain unchanged, as seen on the image below.

Airframes in SimBrief can be edited from the “My fleet” page under the “Dispatch” category. Click “New Airframe” and select an aircraft type. This will take you to the “Airframe Options” page that allows you to modify your selected airframe. Share it by clicking the “Share Aircraft” button in the bottom right corner.

**Airframe option to enter a custom service ceiling** 

The option to enter a custom service ceiling has now been added to SimBrief. To change the service ceiling for a given aircraft type, navigate to the “My fleet” page under “Dispatch system”. Clicking “New Airframe” will allow you to select an aircraft type that you can modify the service ceiling for.
