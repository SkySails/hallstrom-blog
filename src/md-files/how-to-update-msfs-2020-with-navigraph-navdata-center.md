Navigraph offers an update service for the navigational database in Microsoft Flight Simulator, also known as MSFS 2020\. The service installs current navdata directly into your MSFS 2020 from the industry leading provider Jeppesen. In this article we’ll explain how you can get current and worldwide navdata for MSFS 2020 fast and easy.  

**What is navdata?** 

Navdata (also known as FMS Data) is a general purpose dataset used in a wide array of applications, ranging from flight planning systems to various navigational and performance systems onboard the aircraft. The data contains a massive amount of information to determine not only location of airports and waypoints, but also surface type and slope of runways, the layout of airport gates, navaid frequencies, holding patterns, obstacles close to defined routes, and much more.  
  
**Why use navdata from Navigraph?**  

* The navdata we provide is sourced by Jeppesen, a professional navdata provider for major airlines worldwide. The source data is tested and parsed into different data formats adapted to specific addon software designed to increase the realism of flight simulation. Subscribers to our Ultimate plan will enjoy the benefit of having both charts and navdata from Jeppesen that are guaranteed to match each other.
* Navdata from Navigraph is delivered every 28 days according to the aviation industry’s AIRAC cycle. That way you will always be able to access up to date navigational data with a Navigraph subscription.
* The navdata from Navigraph will add airports that are currently missing in the simulator, e.g. EDDS and ZBAD, missing procedures, e.g. ILS 16 at LIRF, missing navaids, VFR waypoints and much more. This is an ongoing project and we are regularly performing updates to our navdata service.\*

_\* The navdata update service from Navigraph will only update the navigational data. To some extent the simulator will attempt to redraw the visual scenery, but this update will not affect buildings, aprons, taxiways, landmarks, geography or anything visual that a scenery developer would work with._  

**Installation instructions**
