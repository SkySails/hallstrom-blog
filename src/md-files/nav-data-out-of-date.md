If you have encountered the “NAV DATA OUT OF DATE” message, or want to know how to get updated navdata for your flight simulators and add-ons, then you’re at the right place! Navigraph has provided the flight simulation community with navigational data since 2006\. In this article we’ll explain how you can get your navdata up to date fast and easy.

**What is navdata?** 

Navdata (also known as FMS Data) is a general purpose dataset used in a wide array of applications, ranging from flight planning systems to various navigational and performance systems onboard the aircraft. The data contains a massive amount of information to determine not only location of airports and waypoints, but also surface type and slope of runways, the layout of airport gates, navaid frequencies, holding patterns, obstacles close to defined routes, and much more.

**Why use navdata from Navigraph?**

* We offer updated and worldwide navigational data from Jeppesen, a professional navdata provider for major airlines worldwide. The source data is tested and parsed into different data formats adapted to specific addon software, designed to increase the realism of flight simulation.
* The navdata from Navigraph is delivered every 28 days according to the aviation industry’s AIRAC cycle. That way you will always be able to access up to date navigational data with a Navigraph subscription.
* Get access to updated navdata for all major add-ons in simulators such as X-Plane, Prepar3D, FSX, and MSFS 2020\. A complete list of supported add-ons can be found in our [developer directory](https://href.li/?https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnavigraph.com%2Fcommunity%2Fdeveloper-directory?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=developer_directory_link&amp;utm_campaign=fms_dmgr)
* The navdata is guaranteed to match Jeppesen charts that can be accessed with a Navigraph Ultimate Subscription. All our subscription options include navdata.

**Installation instructions**

The FMS Data Manager is our application that installs navdata into your favourite add-ons in X-Plane, Prepar3D and FSX. If you wish to install navdata into MSFS 2020, get the [Navigraph Navdata Center](https://navigraph.com/redirect.ashx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.navigraph.com%2Fpost%2F661311268821581825%2Fhow-to-update-msfs-2020-with-navigraph-navdata?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=social&utm_content=blog_navdata_msfs2020_link&utm_campaign=fms_dmgr) instead.

To download the FMS Data Manager, log in to navigraph.com with your credentials and click “Navdata” under the “Downloads” section. The FMS Data Manager is available for both macOS and Windows.

When you have downloaded the FMS Data Manager, start the installer and follow the installation process. After the application has been installed, you will be asked to sign in to the application with your Navigraph credentials. When you have successfully logged in, the application will ask if you wish to scan your hard drive for add-ons. By allowing the FMS Data Manager to look up your add-ons automatically, you don’t need to locate each add-on that you wish to update the navdata for.

When the scan is complete and your add-on aircraft and tools have been located, click on each add-on you wish to update the navdata for, then click the “Update” button.

Your simulator now has professional and updated navdata from Jeppesen! The updated add-ons will use the latest Jeppesen navdata until the next AIRAC cycle releases. On every AIRAC cycle release day, new navdata will be available for installation through the FMS Data Manager.
